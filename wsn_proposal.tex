\chapter{Introduction} % The asterisk leaves out this chapter from the table of contents

It is a commonplace that the Internet is changing our lives.
It is changing the way we learn and also the way we contribute to our communities and organize ourselves.
In this course we will explore the bottom-up creation of a wireless sensor network that can be used to gather and share data.
This gathering and sharing of data empowers the citizenship to monitor and interact with the environment.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{SCK}
\caption{Smart Citizen Kit units. These are wireless nodes with multiple sensors.}
\label{fig:SCK}
\end{marginfigure}

We are interested in the bottom-up models.
We use the terms peer-to-peer, do-it-ourselves and bottom-up interchangeably.
The idea that we want to transmit with bottom-up is that the participant takes an active role and contributes to the community rather than being a mere consumer.
For this reason, we teach the first simple steps to build, configure and program a sensor that uploads the gathered data to the Internet to make it publicly available to those that are interested in.


%------------------------------------------------

\chapter{Methodology}

The course is organized in different units.
Each of the units is a basic ingredient in the construction of a bottom-up wireless sensor networks.
For each of the units, we will follow the same class dynamics.

\section{Class dynamics}

The course is divided into video lectures and written material, both published as the course goes on. Video content include: teaching lessons, interviews and additional instructions for the assignments (when necessary). While the written material is composed by assignments and quizzes. Further details are provided below.

Each unit starts with introductory video lessons in which the lecturer presents the different concepts, tools and examples that are going to be useful for both the assignments and quizzes.
Starting from the necessary theory underlying each unit, the lecturer then guides the students through hands-on examples providing further insight on the subject.

After each unit's video lessons, assignments and quizzes are "unlocked" to the student. Assignments are composed of written (and photographic) material detailing instructions on how to build examples, which work as hints to complete the assignment itself.

After completing the assignments, students are provided with all that is required to successfully complete the end-of-unit quizzes. These in turn are composed of both theory and assignment-related multiple-choice questions.

Teachers will propose challenges on each assignment, often composed of alternative or advanced services that can be added at various stages with little (or none) additional work. Challenges are not graded, but set the ground for a final course project which students may submit in order to gain additional credentials and compensate for previous assignments.

Challenges may be completed by forming groups of students, in fact, collaboration among groups is encouraged. It is strongly believed that discussion and feedback provide more valuable results and are considered as ways of effective learning in this platform.

%The participants will watch a motivation video and a video tutorial.
%The tutorial will describe how to complete a simple project and will be complemented.
%Then, the participants have to collaborate to solve a challenge.
%The teachers offer a suggested challenge, but the participants are free to take other challenges that are relevant to them and to the course.
%Finally, the participants have to carefully document their works so that it can be evaluated, reproduced and discussed by the other participants.

%The first and the last unit are slightly different.
%In the first unit there is no project as the focus is on the presentation of the participants, the course itself and the discussion of the expectations on the course.
%The last unit is also special because the participants design, plan, execute and document their own project. 
%The courses finishes with an exhibition of the personal projects.

\section{In-class courses}
Besides the online offering, the course will also offered in-class for students registered at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
Furthermore it will be possible to use the material for Summer Schools to promote the University and Bottom-up Initiatives.

\section{Resources}


The course will be offered in the P2P University course platform.
The students will be offered with videos, a lab assignment guide with all the details of the different projects, and the discussion and feedback tools of the P2P University platform.
The guide will be adapted from the current guide for the existing in-class course on wireless sensor networks.

\chapter{Working Plan}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Scripting of the course: preparation of the course structure including units segmentation, number/length of videos per unit, assignments and quiz dynamics and evaluation, feedback and collaboration management; and final project evaluation.
	\item Preparation of the written guide: there is already a guide for the in-class course, therefore this new adapted guide should take advantage of on-line resources (video, comments, etc.).
	\item Setting up the P2P University on-line platform: based on the course script, this task will configure the platform accordingly.
	\item Shooting and producing the videos: this final task aims at shooting the videos according to what was designed in the course script and configured in the P2P University platform.
\end{enumerate}


% \begin{itemize}
% \item Scripting of the course: Preparation of detailed scripts of the content of the videos, the guide and the requirements for the online platform.
% \item Shooting and producing the videos: The videos will be shot and produced according to the script.
% \item Preparation of the written guide: There is already a guide for the in-class course, but it needs to be adapted to the on-line course.
% \item Setting up the P2P University on-line platform: This task involves the actual creation and configuration of the online course.

\chapter{Results and Impact}

This course builds upon successful experiences. There is already an existing course that received very good feedback from the students. Also, there is a degree thesis by one of the students that was presented in Battlemesh, Aalborg University, and caught the attention of the P2P Foundation. Furthermore, the idea of bottom-up smart cities implemented by Smart Citizen was applauded in Kickstarter and received over \$60,000 in crowdfunding. 

The hardware used in the course is the Digi XBee, that was also used in the best-selling book by Rober Faludi ``Building Wireless Sensor Networks''; and the Arduino. More than one million Arduino have been sold, confirming the success of their open business model.

The main goal of this course is to strengthen the community by teaching very basic skills to a large audience. After completing the course, the participants will be able to continue on their own with more advanced projects. 

It is a basic digital education for everyone. People with no or little background in technology will make their first steps into programming, electronics, and sensing projects.

Students successfully completing this course will posses the basic tools to contribute to the creation of bottom-up smart cities.
